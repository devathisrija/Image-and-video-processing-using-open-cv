# Image-and-video-processing-using-open-cv
# 🖼️🎥 Image & Video Processor  
_A powerful web-based tool for all your media processing needs_

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Flask-based Image and Video Processing Application** that allows users to perform a wide variety of editing and analysis tasks directly through the browser.  
Built using **Python, Flask, OpenCV, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it eliminates the need for heavy desktop software and provides an easy-to-use, interactive interface.  

Users can:  
- Upload **images** and perform operations such as drawing shapes, adding text/timestamps, resizing, face detection, edge detection, ROI selection, and blending images.  
- Upload **videos** (up to 200MB) and perform frame counting, overlay timestamps, and detect faces on every frame.  
- **Preview and download** processed results (JPG/PNG for images, MP4 for videos).
